# HI! I'M SHIVAM

Shivam, a name which itself feels techy, a name born to revolutionize the tech world.

Starting from my childhood, I was brought up in a tech savvy and well engineered environment surrounded by some marvellous minds. Since my teen years, I was pretty fascinated by "How Tech Works??". Along with me, a keen interest towards innovating new ways for performing simple tasks grew inside me. I got most of the exposure towards engineering and technology, due to my elder brother, who always used to motivate me towards my future goals. Even during my school days, I was known to be the most techy guy in the entire campus.

I'm an introvert, who always thinks about both negative and positive sides of each and every thing. Not only that, I always believe in performing every task perfectly. Talking about my intellectual qualities, I believe I'm an emotional one who does cares about every minute thing.

Futher after my schooling, I got more exposed to technology involving Competitive Programming, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Cyber Security and Internet-of-Things. Later on, I built a deep interaction towards the same and henceforth decided to pursue my career in the same direction.

Today at this stage of life, I feel like I have a lot to do in the near future and I'm waiting for the right pinch..
